MYSQL setup:

Note we're setting a password here to be used by PHP to connect to your
database in MySQL. This is only used internally by nanoblog. It should
be complex. Write down the password you use because it needs to also
be set in the inc_config.php file.

Note you can also use a different database or user name here; if you do
be sure to update these in the inc_config.php file.

    create database nanoblog;
    use nanoblog;
    create table posts (stamp text, body text);
    grant select, insert, update on nanoblog.posts to 'nanouser'@'localhost' 
      identified by 'set-a-database-password-here';
  
HTACCESS setup:

You'll want to password protect the edit.php file (used to create and edit
posts). Use htpasswd to create a new password file. Edit the .htaccess file
to point to it.

BLOG setup:

Edit inc_config.php and change those values as needed. You'll at least have to
set DBPASS to match the MySQL password used above.

TIPS:

You may have to create a blank rss file with open permissions (777) if your
instance of Apache doesn't have write permission on your public html folder.
